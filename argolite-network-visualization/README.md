This project involves visualizing a co-actor network by collecting data from  [TMDb (The Movie Database)](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

Steps followed:

1) Collect data from TMDb using API calls.
2) Build a co-actor network graph for the actor's highest rated movies (having a vote average >= 8.0). Store the graph results in nodes.csv and edges.csv respectively.
3) Visualize the network using [Argo Lite](https://github.com/poloclub/argo-graph-lite)  

**Source code will be provided upon request**.
