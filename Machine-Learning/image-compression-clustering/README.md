This assignment focuses on implementing the K-means clustering algorithm , and applying it for image compression. K-means implementation was experimented using:  

1. Squared L-2 norm as distance metric 
2. L-norm as a distance metric
3. Different initialization centroids.

Different clusters sizes (k = 2,4,8,16) were experimented to compare the compressed image quality.  

The images are available in data/ folder and consolidated results are uploaded in the results/ folder.  

**Source code will be provided upon request**.
