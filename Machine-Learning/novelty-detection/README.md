This is an example using a one-class SVM for novelty detection(One-class SVM with non-linear kernel (RBF).  

:ref:`One-class SVM <svm_outlier_detection>` is an unsupervised algorithm that learns a decision function for novelty detection: classifying new data as similar or different to the training set.
