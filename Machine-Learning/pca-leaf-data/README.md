This implementation is a Principal component analysis on the UCI leaf dataset. This dataset consists in a collection of shape and texture features extracted from digital images of leaf specimens originating from a total of 40 different plant species.  

The top 2 principal components are extracted and data points are visuaized in a scatter plot.
