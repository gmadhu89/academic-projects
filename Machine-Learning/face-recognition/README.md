This folder contains implementation simple face recognition of an image dataset using Principal Component Analysis. Algorithm for performing principal component analysis was implemented from scratch. Below are the steps involved :  

1. Analyze images of 2 subjects (persons) from Yale Face dataset, and obtain the top 6 eigen faces for each subject.  
2. Perform classification of image using Eigen faces (after PCA), by calculating projection residual of test images with the eigen faces for each subject.
