This analysis involves identifying whether or not the two brain regions are likely to be independent of each other and considering different types of political view using Kernel Density Estimation method for "n90pol.csv" dataset. This dataset contains information on 90 university students who participated in a psychological
experiment designed to look for relationships between the size of different regions of the brain and political views.  

The variables amygdala and acc indicate the volume of two particular brain regions known to be involved in emotions and decision-making, the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex; more exactly, these are residuals from the predicted volume, after adjusting for height, sex, and similar body-type variables. The variable orientation gives the students' locations on a five-point scale from 1 (very conservative) to 5 (very liberal). Note that in the dataset, we only have observations for orientation from 2 to 5.
