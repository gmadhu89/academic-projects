Mental health is an increasingly important concern in today’s world. It is estimated that 16.2 million adults in the United States, or 6.7 percent of American adults, have had at least one major depressive episode each year. Depression tends to affect people in their prime working years and is one of the top 3 workplace problems.  

The purpose of this project is to tackle this problem by evaluating data related to prevalence of mental health disorders in the IT workplace and generate a profile for adults most prone to depression. This will help understand the risk factors that contribute to mental health disorders. The insights can also help guide company policies regarding mental health resources to protect their employees in the workplace. The following list comprise the research questions proposed:  

• Investigate the impact of geographical location on the amount or the probability of seeking treatment for mental illnesses.  
• Determine the effect of a company’s mental health coverage policy on the amount of employees seeking treatment.  
• Investigate the effect of negative workplace sentiment on the number of people seeking treatment.  
• Determine whether a person with a history of mental illness is more prone to facing another mental health issue.  
• Determine if an employee’s gender influences whether they feel that mental health concerns can be brought up in their workplace.  
• Determine factors that are significantly determine the probability of people seeking treatment for mental illness.
